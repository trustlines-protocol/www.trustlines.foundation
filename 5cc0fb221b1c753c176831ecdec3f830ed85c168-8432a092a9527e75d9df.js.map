This blockchain requires a\r\n        native coin, the Trustlines Network Coin (TLC), analogous to Bitcoin or\r\n        Ether in Ethereum, which will be used by those interacting with the\r\n        blockchain as a means of payment to the Validators for validating their\r\n        transactions/interactions on the Trustlines Blockchain.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        To distribute TLC, Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) will be created and\r\n        made available to Eligible Parties via the Ethereum Mainchain through\r\n        different distribution methods. Initially however via the Merkle Drop.\r\n        The Ethereum Mainchain was chosen for this due to interoperability with\r\n        the Trustlines Blockchain and because the already existing Ethereum\r\n        address balances and information on the Ethereum Mainchain make the\r\n        chosen Eligible Party selection methodology possible. Once Claimed from\r\n        the Merkle Drop Smart Contract, the TLN will be able to be converted to\r\n        TLC on the Trustlines Blockchain using the Trustlines Bridge.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>The Trustlines Foundation’s role in this process comprises</h2>\r\n\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          The organisation of the creation of the Contracts and related software\r\n          components;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          The selection of Eligible Parties and determining their respective\r\n          allocation of TLN;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>The collection of Ethereum addresses from the Eligible Parties;</li>\r\n        <li>The deployment of the Contracts; and</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          The organisation of the creation, and deployment of the Trustlines\r\n          Bridge.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h1>How the Merkle Drop works</h1>\r\n\r\n      <h2>In General</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        To make Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) available for Eligible Parties\r\n        to Claim, a Merkle drop model was chosen as the first distribution\r\n        method. Merkle drops (or merkle mines) are a variant of air drops or\r\n        smart drops, in which tokens are not actively sent or transferred to the\r\n        intended recipients, but are made available so that the tokens may be\r\n        claimed by a predetermined group is they so desire. In the case of the\r\n        Merkle Drop, a Smart Contract containing a Merkle root is deployed on\r\n        the Ethereum Mainchain, from which an Eligible Party can Claim their TLN\r\n        allocation using an on-chain transaction which provides a Merkle Proof\r\n        to the Merkle Drop Smart Contract allowing them to Claim their allocated\r\n        TLN. This method allows Eligible Parties to Claim their allocated TLN\r\n        without the need of any action by the Foundation or any third party.\r\n        Once the Merkle Drop Smart Contract is deployed, neither the Foundation\r\n        nor any other party will have control over the Merkle Drop Smart\r\n        Contract, thereby ensuring that no changes can be made to the list of\r\n        Eligible Parties and/or the allocated TLN.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>\r\n        Creation of the Merkle Root for the Merkle Drop Smart Contract and its\r\n        deployment\r\n      </h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Merkle trees are used to validate large amounts of data in an efficient\r\n        way by combining multiple values and their hashes in a single fixed-size\r\n        value - a Merkle root. In the case at hand, the Foundation will use the\r\n        Eligible Party Ethereum addresses and their respective TLN allocation\r\n        (see Eligible Party selection methodology) to create a Merkle Tree and\r\n        include its Merkle Root into the Merkle Drop Smart Contract which it\r\n        will deploy on the Ethereum Mainchain.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Claiming tokens from the Merkle Drop Smart Contract</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Merkle proofs are a way to provide proof that a certain value is part of\r\n        a set of data without the need of exposing the complete set of data.\r\n        More specifically, in the Merkle Drop, a Merkle Proof that a Ethereum\r\n        address is included within the Merkle Root of the Merkle Drop Smart\r\n        Contract needs to be provided to the Merkle Drop Smart Contract in order\r\n        for an Eligible Party to Claim its allocated TLN.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        <strong>Step1</strong> - confirming if an Ethereum address is an\r\n        Eligible Party Ethereum address: open the&nbsp;\r\n        <a href=\"https://trustlines.foundation/merkle-drop.html\">Merkle Drop</a>\r\n        &nbsp; and enter the Ethereum address that you want to check.

Any successful attacks present a risk to the\r\n          Merkle Drop;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risk of hacking and security weaknesses: hackers or other malicious\r\n          groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Merkle Drop\r\n          in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks,\r\n          denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,\r\n          smurfing, and spoofing;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risk of uninsured Losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at\r\n          financial institutions, the TLN held in the Contracts is uninsured\r\n          unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus,\r\n          in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public\r\n          insurer or private insurance arranged by the Foundation, to offer\r\n          recourse to you;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions:\r\n          the regulatory status of, including but not limited to the Merkle\r\n          Drop, the TLN and TLC, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or\r\n          unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or\r\n          whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect\r\n          to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to\r\n          predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may\r\n          implement changes to law and regulations affecting distributed ledger\r\n          technology and its applications, including but not limited to the\r\n          Merkle Drop and the TLN and TLC. Regulatory actions could negatively\r\n          impact the whole Trustlines Protocol in various ways, including, for\r\n          purposes of illustration only, that some or all of the parties\r\n          involved in the Trustlines Protocol in general might require licensing\r\n          or is subject to existing licensing requirements;\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risks arising from taxation; the tax characterization of the Merkle\r\n          Drop, claiming TLN and of TLN and TLC in general is uncertain. You\r\n          must seek your own tax advice before Claiming TLN from the Merkle Drop\r\n          Smart Contract, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you,\r\n          including but not limited to withholding taxes, income taxes and tax\r\n          reporting requirements.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Unanticipated risks: blockchain technology and the Trustlines Protocol\r\n          are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks referred\r\n          to above, there are other risks associated with the Merkle Drop,\r\n          including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as\r\n          unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks previously\r\n          referred to.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Indemnification</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,\r\n        defend and hold harmless the Foundation and its Affiliates from and\r\n        against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and\r\n        expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to (i)\r\n        you participating in the Merkle drop; (ii) your obligations,\r\n        representations and warranties under these Terms, (iii) your violation\r\n        of these Terms, and/or (iv) your violation of any rights of any other\r\n        person or entity directly and indirectly related to the Merkle drop.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Exclusion of Warranties</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        To the full extent permitted by law, no warranty, guarantee or similar\r\n        assurance whatsoever is expressed or implied with regard to the\r\n        Trustlines Protocol and its components.

The Eligible Party is not relying on the\r\n        Foundation with respect to the legal, tax and general economic factors\r\n        involved in entering into these Terms and understands that it is solely\r\n        responsible for reviewing the legal, tax and general economic\r\n        considerations involved with Claiming TLN from the Merkle Drop Smart\r\n        Contract with its own legal, tax and other advisers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The Eligible Party acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent\r\n        permitted by any applicable law, it will not hold the Foundation and any\r\n        of its Affiliates liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\r\n        consequential or exemplary damages (including but not limited to loss of\r\n        income, revenue and profits, or goodwill, or data) or injury whatsoever\r\n        caused by or related to his/her partaking (or inability to partake) in\r\n        the Merkle Drop or the use (or inability to use) of the Contracts under\r\n        any cause of action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction.\r\n        <br />\r\n        The Eligible Party acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent\r\n        permitted by any applicable law, the risks associated with Claiming TLN\r\n        from the Merkle Drop Smart Contract, owning and holding TLN rests\r\n        entirely with the Eligible Party.\r\n        <br />\r\n        The limitations set forth in the Clause do not and will not limit or\r\n        exclude liability of the Foundation for fraud or intentional, willful or\r\n        reckless misconduct.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Release</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Merkle Drop\r\n        participant releases the Foundation and its Affiliates from\r\n        responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and\r\n        consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including,\r\n        but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to\r\n        Disputes between the parties and out of or related to the acts or\r\n        omissions of any third parties and or affiliates.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Disputes: Binding Arbitration</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Any Dispute shall first be endeavoured to be settled through amicable\r\n        negotiations in good faith by the Parties.
