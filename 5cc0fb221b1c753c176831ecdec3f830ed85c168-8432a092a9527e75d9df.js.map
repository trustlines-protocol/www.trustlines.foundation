This blockchain requires a\n        native coin, the Trustlines Network Coin (TLC), analogous to Bitcoin or\n        Ether in Ethereum, which will be used by those interacting with the\n        blockchain as a means of payment to the Validators for validating their\n        transactions/interactions on the Trustlines Blockchain.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        To distribute TLC, Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) will be created and\n        made available to Eligible Parties via the Ethereum Mainchain through\n        different distribution methods. Initially however via the Merkle Drop.\n        The Ethereum Mainchain was chosen for this due to interoperability with\n        the Trustlines Blockchain and because the already existing Ethereum\n        address balances and information on the Ethereum Mainchain make the\n        chosen Eligible Party selection methodology possible. Once Claimed from\n        the Merkle Drop Smart Contract, the TLN will be able to be converted to\n        TLC on the Trustlines Blockchain using the Trustlines Bridge.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>The Trustlines Foundation’s role in this process comprises</h2>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          The organisation of the creation of the Contracts and related software\n          components;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The selection of Eligible Parties and determining their respective\n          allocation of TLN;\n        </li>\n        <li>The collection of Ethereum addresses from the Eligible Parties;</li>\n        <li>The deployment of the Contracts; and</li>\n        <li>\n          The organisation of the creation, and deployment of the Trustlines\n          Bridge.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h1>How the Merkle Drop works</h1>\n\n      <h2>In General</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        To make Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) available for Eligible Parties\n        to Claim, a Merkle drop model was chosen as the first distribution\n        method. Merkle drops (or merkle mines) are a variant of air drops or\n        smart drops, in which tokens are not actively sent or transferred to the\n        intended recipients, but are made available so that the tokens may be\n        claimed by a predetermined group is they so desire. In the case of the\n        Merkle Drop, a Smart Contract containing a Merkle root is deployed on\n        the Ethereum Mainchain, from which an Eligible Party can Claim their TLN\n        allocation using an on-chain transaction which provides a Merkle Proof\n        to the Merkle Drop Smart Contract allowing them to Claim their allocated\n        TLN. This method allows Eligible Parties to Claim their allocated TLN\n        without the need of any action by the Foundation or any third party.\n        Once the Merkle Drop Smart Contract is deployed, neither the Foundation\n        nor any other party will have control over the Merkle Drop Smart\n        Contract, thereby ensuring that no changes can be made to the list of\n        Eligible Parties and/or the allocated TLN.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>\n        Creation of the Merkle Root for the Merkle Drop Smart Contract and its\n        deployment\n      </h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Merkle trees are used to validate large amounts of data in an efficient\n        way by combining multiple values and their hashes in a single fixed-size\n        value - a Merkle root. In the case at hand, the Foundation will use the\n        Eligible Party Ethereum addresses and their respective TLN allocation\n        (see Eligible Party selection methodology) to create a Merkle Tree and\n        include its Merkle Root into the Merkle Drop Smart Contract which it\n        will deploy on the Ethereum Mainchain.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Claiming tokens from the Merkle Drop Smart Contract</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Merkle proofs are a way to provide proof that a certain value is part of\n        a set of data without the need of exposing the complete set of data.\n        More specifically, in the Merkle Drop, a Merkle Proof that a Ethereum\n        address is included within the Merkle Root of the Merkle Drop Smart\n        Contract needs to be provided to the Merkle Drop Smart Contract in order\n        for an Eligible Party to Claim its allocated TLN.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <strong>Step1</strong> - confirming if an Ethereum address is an\n        Eligible Party Ethereum address: open the&nbsp;\n        <a href=\"https://trustlines.foundation/merkle-drop.html\">Merkle Drop</a>\n        &nbsp; and enter the Ethereum address that you want to check.

If a Merkle Proof is\n        successfully generated, the website will interact with the web3 provider\n        and initiate the creation of a transaction to Claim the TLN. By clicking\n        the respective claim button and approving the transaction, the Merkle\n        Drop Smart Contract is instructed to transfer the maximum amount of\n        Claimable TLN to the Eligible Party Ethereum address.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Warnings and recommendations</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Note that a Claiming transaction can only be signed by the Ethereum\n          address of an Eligible Party Ethereum address.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Note you will need to have sufficient ETH to pay for the transaction\n          to be processed on the Ethereum Mainchain.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          No guarantee is given with regard to the proper functioning of the\n          web3 provider, the Merkle Drop Website or the integration of each of\n          these.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>\n        To ensure future economics of the Trustlines Blockchain Claiming TLN\n        will only be possible within 2 years starting from the deployment of the\n        Merkle Drop Smart Contract.

The technical experts have confirmed\n        to the Foundation that the Contracts have, with regard to both accuracy\n        and security, been programmed according to the current state of the art.\n        The Eligible Party however, understands and accepts that smart contract\n        technology is still in an early development stage and its application is\n        of an experimental nature which carries significant operational,\n        technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.\n        Accordingly, while the conducted review and testing raises the level of\n        security and accuracy, in theory, the Eligible Party understands and\n        accepts that the review and testing does not amount to any form of\n        warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Contracts are\n        fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses,\n        vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss\n        of the TLN or TLC or your ETH.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Associated risks</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        By Claiming TLN from the Merkle Drop Smart Contract, you expressly\n        acknowledge and assume the following risks:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Risk of losing ETH, TLN, TLC or other tokens due to loss of private\n          key(s);\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risks associated with the Ethereum blockchain: any malfunction,\n          breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a\n          material adverse effect on the Contracts;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risk of mining attacks: the Contracts are susceptible to attacks by\n          miners on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to\n          double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and\n          selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the\n          Merkle Drop;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risk of hacking and security weaknesses: hackers or other malicious\n          groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Merkle Drop\n          in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks,\n          denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,\n          smurfing, and spoofing;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risk of uninsured Losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at\n          financial institutions, the TLN held in the Contracts is uninsured\n          unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus,\n          in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public\n          insurer or private insurance arranged by the Foundation, to offer\n          recourse to you;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions:\n          the regulatory status of, including but not limited to the Merkle\n          Drop, the TLN and TLC, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or\n          unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or\n          whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect\n          to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to\n          predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may\n          implement changes to law and regulations affecting distributed ledger\n          technology and its applications, including but not limited to the\n          Merkle Drop and the TLN and TLC. Regulatory actions could negatively\n          impact the whole Trustlines Protocol in various ways, including, for\n          purposes of illustration only, that some or all of the parties\n          involved in the Trustlines Protocol in general might require licensing\n          or is subject to existing licensing requirements;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Risks arising from taxation; the tax characterization of the Merkle\n          Drop, claiming TLN and of TLN and TLC in general is uncertain.
