    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Make a bid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To bid in the auction, you need to send a transaction to the auction contract with enough gas and an amount of TLN that is greater or equal to the current slot price.</li>
    <li>
      Any excess TLN can be withdrawn after the auction ends. You can find the auction contract address on the website.<br />

      </div>
    </li>
    <li>You may need to go to the “Advanced Options” in MetaMask to set the gas limit by yourself.</li>
    <li>MetaMask will use the default <strong>gas limit</strong> of 21,000, which is too low. We recommend a gas limit of 400,000. <strong>Note that this is a limit and setting it too high has no consequences on the effective price of the transaction while setting it too low may cause the transaction to fail.</strong></li>
    <li>You can leave the <strong>gas price</strong> as suggested by MetaMask.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Confirm the bid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use Etherscan or your wallet to confirm that the bid was successful.</li>
    <li>
      If the bid was successful, the transaction will be displayed as “Confirmed”:<br />
