  <h2>Participation requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Make yourself familiar with how the Trustlines validator auction works. Visit the auction.trustlines.foundation website and watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/DFrg6EaOUOk">Trustlines Auction Explained</a> video.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have been accepted and signed up as a <a href="https://blog.trustlines.network/become-a-trustlines-validator-candidate-using-proof-of-sociality">Trustlines auction validator candidate</a>.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have whitelisted your Etherum address.</li>
    <li>Use a wallet where you can specify a gas limit. This documentation uses <a href="http://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Make sure the auction is started and ongoing. Go to the website and look at the remaining time for the auction. If a remaining time is displayed and counting down, the auction is ongoing.<br />

    <li>Alternatively, you can observe the starting time of the auction on the graph.</li>

    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Make a bid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To bid in the auction, you need to send a transaction to the auction contract with enough gas and an amount of TLN that is greater or equal to the current slot price.</li>
    <li>
      Any excess TLN will be refunded later. You can find the auction contract address on the website.<br />

      </div>
    </li>
    <li>You may need to go to the “Advanced Options” to set the gas limit by yourself.</li>
    <li>MetaMask will use the default gas limit of 21,000, which is too low. We recommend a gas limit of 400.000. <strong>Note that this is a limit and setting it too high has no consequences on the effective price of the transaction while setting it too low may cause the transaction to fail.</strong></li>
    <li>You can leave the gas price as suggested by MetaMask.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Confirm the bid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use Etherscan or your wallet to confirm that the bid was successful.</li>
    <li>
      If the bid was successful, the transaction will be displayed as “Confirmed”:<br />
