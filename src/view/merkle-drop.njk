            <p>Trustlines Blockchain requires transaction fees to be paid in the cryptocurrency native to the blockchain: the Trustlines Network Coins (TLC). However, in order to reach a broad set of individuals, a Merkle drop (a “non-spammy” version of an
              airdrop) of Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) will be conducted on Ethereum. TLN are ERC20 tokens which can be converted to TLC by sending them to a bridge contract.</p>
            <p>The Merkle drop is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It contains a list of addresses and the amount of claimable Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) per address in the form of a Merkle root. In order to claim the tokens, recipients
              will have to provide a Merkle proof to this contract which shows that they are entitled to TLN.</p>
            <p>Trustlines Foundation aims to distribute up to 70% of TLN of which 50% will be allocated in the first Merkle drop. More details will be communicated once the final Merkle drop list has been created.</p>
            <p>The tokens won’t be pushed onto accounts, but will instead have to be claimed from the Merkle drop smart contract.</p>

            <h2>Merkle Drop FAQ</h2>
            
            <h3>1. What is the Trustlines Merkle drop?</h3>
            <p>The Trustlines Merkle drop is a token distribution method chosen by the Trustlines Foundation for the Trustlines Network Token.</p>

            <h3>2. Why did you choose a Merkle drop?</h3>
            <p>The Trustlines Foundation based the distribution method design principles of the
              <a href="https://medium.com/@DJohnstonEC/the-smartdrop-model-859888916d94" target="_blank">smart drop</a>.</p>
            <p>The Merkle drop is used as a tool to</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reward early contributors, e.g. validators, testers, developers and others</li>
              <li>Target potential stakeholders of the Trustlines Network, e.g. individuals/ projects aligned with the mission of Trustlines, who may turn into users of the Trustlines technology stack</li>
              <li>Make TLC available to a wide audience consisting of addresses and individuals from within the crypto and community currency ecosystems by providing them with TLN that they can convert into TLC via the bridge</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>3. Can I receive multiple allocations of TLN?</h3>
          <p>Yes. There are two ways in which this could happen.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You happen to control the private key of multiple eligible Ethereum addresses.</li>
            <li>One or more of your eligible Ethereum addresses were included in multiple lists.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>4. Is TLN freely transferable/tradeable?</h3>
          <p>Yes, it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainchain.</p>

          <h3>5. Can I withdraw tokens to an address other than the one I’m claiming with?</h3>
          <p>No. You will need to have control of the private key associated with the address.</p>

          <h3>6. How much of the Total supply of TLN is in the first Merkle drop?</h3>
          <p>50% with another 20% scheduled for future airdrops.</p>

          <h3>7. Which addresses are included in the Merkle drop?</h3>
          <p>These are the groups of eligible addresses that can now claim their TLN tokens.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Early contributors to the
              <a href="https://trustlines.network/" target="_blank">Trustlines Network</a>
              ecosystem. This includes, for example, testers and
              <a href="https://explore.laika.trustlines.foundation/" target="_blank">testnet</a>
              validators, as well as those who whitelisted their address to become validators, but did not secure a slot in the
              <a href="auction/">auction</a>
            </li>
            <li>People who were interested in participating in the drop via our
              <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustlinesFound/status/1201901024576987137" target="_blank">community channels</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://ethberlinzwei.com/" target="_blank">ETHBerlin2</a>
              hackers</li>
            <li>Addresses included in the Genesis block of
              <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>
              (with at least one transfer executed)</li>
            <li>MKR, BNT and DAI token holders</li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/the-dxdao-has-awoken-78cb2e39661c" target="_blank">dxDAO</a>
              Rep holders and
              <a href="https://www.humanitydao.org/" target="_blank">HumanityDAO</a>
              human participants</li>
            <li>POAP, Proof-of-Attendance NFT holders</li>
            <li>Collection of ETH addresses, that underwent some form of identity verification in the past</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8. How many TLN do I get?</h3>
          <p>This is highly dependent on which group your address inherits eligibility from. Overall, individual early contributors and testers receive more tokens than individuals from larger groups of token holders.</p>

          <h3>9. What can I do with my TLN?</h3>
          <p>TLN is an ERC20 token that can be traded with buyers or be converted to TLC by sending them to a bridge contract.</p>
