            <h1>The Trustlines Grant</h1>
            <h2>1. Background</h2>
            <p class="content-large">
              The Trustlines Foundation pursues the charitable goal of promoting financial and economic inclusion of all people through decentralised peer-to-peer network protocols that serve common accounting. To ensure the pursuit of this goal in the long term, the Trustlines Foundation provides grants to projects that actively contribute to the development and the usage of the Trustlines ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility requirements</h2>
            <ul class="content-large">
              <li><b>Open source software</b>
                <p>
                  As the Trustlines Foundation values and aims to promote the philosophy of decentralised networks, projects should respectively also be open source in order to be aligned.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><b>Aiding the Trustlines cause</b>
                <p>
                  We are offering grants to anyone who is willing to contribute to the growth and development of the Trustlines ecosystem. This condition is kept unspecific as we desire to foster all types of projects as long as they support our mission.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Exemplary projects</h2>
            <p><i>If you already have the idea that you want to pursue, you can either skip the following part or gather some extra-inspiration.</i></p>
            <p class="content-large">
              We are aware that there is a sheer endless amount of different projects that could be undertaken while also following our eligibility requirements. Furthermore, we know that best ideas may be entirely unexpected, yet we want to share some rough examples for possible projects with you, which came to our minds when elaborating on the concept of providing this grant:
            </p>
            <ul class="content-large">
              <li><b>Community currency projects</b> that build on top or integrate with Trustlines protocol, e.g. regional currency networks</li>
              <li><b>Adaptation to specifications</b>, e.g. developing or deploying variations of the Trustlines protocol to achieve a fit of the system with local, cultural or religious requirements, for example deploying a currency network that disables interest rates for an islamic finance use case</li>
              <li><b>User adoption</b>, e.g. creating educational resources, organizing meetups, hosting workshops, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Research</b>, e.g. economics PhD researching credit networks or P2P payment channel networks, especially with respect to the so-called “imbalanced channel” problem</li>
              <li><b>UX enhancements</b>, e.g. building a more advanced mobile application or integrating localisation features</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Our value proposition</h2>
            <h3>Funding</h3>
            <p>The total size of the grant depends on the scope of your project, your specific requirements and the estimated budget of the project. It will be paid out in TLN.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, milestones might potentially be defined for each stage of the project during the application process. These milestones can include criteria that will be required to be met in order to release further payouts.</p>
            <p>Lastly, further grants will also be available, subject to the progress of your project.</p>

            <h3>Mentorship</h3>
            <p>To ultimately leverage the  potential of your project, we also offer mentorship by providing you access to our network in the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, if you are looking for exchange opportunities, we are happy to use our connections to other community currency projects.</p>

            <h3>Use of trademarks</h3>
            <p>Last but not least, the Trustlines trademarks owned by the Foundation can be used by projects building on top of the Trustlines protocol in accordance with its Trustlines Trademark Guidelines. This way your project can already benefit from the popularity of the Trustlines protocol starting day one.</p>
            <p>For example, this trademark will give you better access to the existing Trustlines community and thus increase your reach to promote your project to potential users.</p>
            <p>Please find more information about our trademarks and how to work with them <a href="https://docs.trustlines.network/docs/foundation/trademarks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
