Personal information we collect</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect certain\r\n        information about you and your device, including information about your\r\n        web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are\r\n        installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we may\r\n        collect information about the individual web pages or products that you\r\n        view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and\r\n        information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this\r\n        automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” We collect\r\n        Device Information using the following technologies:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data\r\n          including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,\r\n          referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Additionally, if you sign up for a newsletter through the Site, we\r\n        collect your name and email address.

When registering via\r\n        your Github account, we may additionally have access to your Github\r\n        username. When registering via your Twitter account, we may additionally\r\n        have access to your Twitter account information such as your tweets,\r\n        settings and blocked users. (We're not storing this information from\r\n        Twitter, the email address is what is used for the account creation at\r\n        the forum, the app is a Twitter app using the API and that's why it asks\r\n        for such a list of items.) We refer to all this information above as\r\n        “Subscription Information.” In the course of our interactions, we may\r\n        also collect a record and details of any correspondence or\r\n        communications between you and us relating to any information request or\r\n        job application submitted to us.

How do we use your personal information?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Your Subscription Information will only be used to send you the\r\n        subscribed newsletter by email. Your name is given so that we can\r\n        address you personally in the newsletter and, if necessary, identify you\r\n        if you want to exercise your rights as a data subject. To receive the\r\n        newsletter, it is sufficient to enter your email address. When you\r\n        register to receive our newsletter, the data you provide will only be\r\n        used for this purpose. Subscribers can also be informed via email about\r\n        circumstances that are relevant to the service or registration (e.g.\r\n        changes to the newsletter offer or technical conditions). For an\r\n        effective registration, we need a valid email address. In order to check\r\n        that a registration is actually made by the owner of an email address,\r\n        we use the \"double opt-in\" procedure. For this purpose, we log the order\r\n        of the newsletter, the sending of a confirmation email and the receipt\r\n        of the response requested. Further data is not collected. The data will\r\n        only be used for sending the newsletter and will not be passed on to\r\n        third parties.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        We use or may use the Subscription Information regarding our other\r\n        personalized services and Communication Information that we collect\r\n        generally to communicate with you and to provide any other information\r\n        you have requested or respond to any other correspondence. If you are\r\n        registered with us, you can access content and services that we only\r\n        offer to registered users. Registered users also have the option of\r\n        changing or deleting the data provided when registering at any time. If\r\n        users leave comments or forum posts on our website, the time of their\r\n        creation and the user name previously selected by the user are saved in\r\n        addition to this information. This serves our security as we can be\r\n        prosecuted for illegal content on our website, even if it was created by\r\n        users.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for\r\n        potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more\r\n        generally to improve and optimize our Site (ensuring a problem-free\r\n        connection to the website, evaluating system security and stability and\r\n        for other administrative purposes). (This processing for our legitimate\r\n        interests in managing the information we provide via our Site and to\r\n        assess how people use the Site.) We do not use your Personal Information\r\n        to draw conclusions about you personally.

Sharing your personal information</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We share your Personal Information with third parties such as processors\r\n        to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. We may\r\n        disclose your Personal Information to other third-parties that enable us\r\n        to provide the Site and any connected services including technical\r\n        support providers who may have access to personal data. These may\r\n        include software and website developers, IT support and mail management\r\n        service providers. In all cases, our agreement with the relevant third\r\n        party will contain appropriate provisions regarding the use and security\r\n        of your Personal Information. Finally, we may also share your Personal\r\n        Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond\r\n        to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we\r\n        receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>5.
