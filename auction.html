The Ethereum address of successful bidders in a successful Auction will be included in the Validator Set.<ol><li><strong>Acceptable tokens for a bid</strong>: The Auction is a smart contract on the Ethereum Mainchain. Note that the smart contract will not accept any other tokens than the Trustlines Network Token as a bid.<li><strong>Participation</strong>: To be able to participate in the Auction, your Ethereum address must have been whitelisted by the Foundation prior to the start of the Auction. Every whitelisted Ethereum address can participate in the auction only once. <strong>Do not send your Trustlines Network Tokens to the auction contract since this will result in you losing your tokens. Instead, use the bid feature on the Trustlines auction page.</strong><li><strong>Timing</strong>: The Auction ends after 14 days starting from the Start Date or when the 36th successful bid is received by the smart contract. Whichever comes first.<li><strong>Threshold</strong>: If fewer than 15 Ethereum addresses have successfully participated at the time the Auction ends, it will fail. No Validator slots will be awarded and all participants can withdraw their bids. If 15 or more successful bids were received, the Auction will succeed.<li><strong>Limited Validator Slots</strong>: 36 Validator Slots are up for auction.</ol><h2>How the Auction works</h2><p>The Auction begins when a transaction is sent by the Foundation at the Start Date. After this transaction, the smart contract operates independently and the Foundation will neither have nor retain any control or influence over it.<p>Once initialized, the Auction starts at a price of 50,000,000 Trustlines Network Tokens per Validator Slot. Then the price will continuously decrease over time as defined by the following parameters & functions:<pre>
    t = elapsed_time_in_ms / auction_duration_in_days,
    price = price_start * (1+t) / (1+t+decay),
    decay = (t^3) / 746571428571
  </pre><p>whereby:<ul><li><strong>elapsed_time_in_ms</strong> is the elapsed time in ms since the auction started<li><strong>auction_duration_in_days</strong> equals 14 days<li><strong>price_start</strong> equals 50,000,000 Trustlines Network Tokens</ul><p>When the price falls to a point that a Validator Candidate thinks is fair, they can submit their bid over the trustlines auction <a href="https://trustlines.foundation/auction">page</a>. If and when the transaction is successfully included in the Ethereum Mainchain, the Validator Candidate has obtained a Validator Slot in the event of a successful Auction (see Threshold).<p>If the Auction is successful, all Validator Slots are priced equal, i.e. being equal to the price of the last successful bid received by the smart contract. Every participant can withdraw the difference between the end Validator Slot price and their bid.<p>The final Validator Slot price of each Validator Slot cannot be withdrawn from the smart contract and will be transferred to the Deposit Locker (more info in the definition of the Validator Auction) smart contract and kept there as a Stake for 9 months starting from the date the Auction ends (see Timing). Once the 9 months have passed, Validators can withdraw their Stake provided it doesn’t get slashed due to equivocation.<h2>Validator technical capabilities</h2><p>If a Validator Candidate successfully bid for a slot in the Auction, he/she will be included in the Validator Set. This will allow the Validator to run a validator node which can create blocks on the Trustlines Blockchain. Additionally to validating and creating blocks (including the genesis block) they will also be able to operate the Trustlines Bridge which is used to exchange Trustlines Network Tokens from the Ethereum Mainchain to Trustlines Network Coins on the Trustlines Blockchain. Other than these described capabilities there are no other unique capabilities connected solely to a Validator slot.<h2>Why participate</h2><p>The Trustlines Blockchain is a minimal viable Proof of Stake sidechain to the Ethereum Mainchain and is governed by a greenfield governance model in which Validators can gain technical and governance experience with such an experimental consensus model.<p>Besides the Validator technical capabilities mentioned above, Validators will also receive block rewards (as to be defined within the chain spec) in the form of Trustlines Network Coins if they actively run their validator node and take part in block creation. They will also be in a position to charge transaction fees for transactions that are included within the blocks a Validator creates.<p>Note that receiving block rewards and transaction fees is dependent on a community of Validators emerging and the potential users of the Trustlines Blockchain. The Foundation cannot guarantee that a Trustlines Blockchain including the Chain Spec as proposed by the Foundation actually emerges out of the actions of these third party stakeholders. Hence, participating in the Auction and thereby agreeing to these Terms and Conditions does not entail a right or an entitlement in any way whatsoever to either becoming and/or remaining a Validator or receiving block rewards and/or transaction fees.<h2>General remarks, recommendations and good practice</h2><p>Bidding Trustlines Network Tokens in the Auction does not guarantee a Validator Slot. Especially, your bid/transaction will be rejected:<ul><li>If you bid from an Ethereum address that isn’t whitelisted<li>If you bid less than the current Auction price<li>If you bid before the Auction has started or after the auction has ended<li>If you have already bid in the Auction (multiple bids will not result in more than one slot. Only 1 slot per Ethereum address).</ul><p>Additionally:<ul><li>The Auction might not meet the threshold of 15bidders, in which case the Auction has failed and the Trustlines Network Tokens can be withdrawn from the smart contract by its respective Auction participant.<li>The current Validators might choose not to fork the Trustlines Blockchain with the new validator set. This requires at least 50% of the current Validator Set to do so.<li>Users of the Trustlines Blockchain or projects building on top of it might align on a different Validator Set, therefore choosing a different fork of the Trustlines Blockchain rendering the Validator Set determined by the auction obsolete. Validators will still be able to withdraw their Stake after the 9-month staking period.</ul><p>The functioning of the Ethereum mainchain is out of the control of the Foundation, so the Foundation cannot be held liable for any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol and/or the Ethereum Mainchain.<p>All actions are voluntary, there is no obligation to take part in the Auction.<p>Validators can be removed from the Validator Set by the majority of the Trustlines Blockchain community by hard forking. Validators removed from the Validator set in such a way will neither earn block rewards nor transaction fees going forward. The Stake on the Ethereum Mainchain will remain locked for the remainder of the 9-month Staking period and will be slashable if equivocation can be proved.<h1>Definitions</h1><p><strong>Affiliate(s)</strong> means any and all persons and or entities directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person, where control may be by either management authority, contract or equity interest.<p><strong>Ethereum Mainchain or Ethereum blockchain</strong> means the smart contract protocol, virtual machine and decentralized network including all its related components and protocol-related projects both present and future, which​ ​began​ ​operation​ ​(Genesis​ ​Block)​ ​on​ ​July​ ​30th,​ ​2015.<p><strong>Ether (ETH)</strong> means the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum mainchain, i.e. the blockchain token​ ​of​ ​Ethereum.<p><strong>Trustlines Network</strong> is short for “The Trustlines Network ecosystem”, which is an ecosystem of entities, individuals, and code that aims to promote financial & economic inclusion of all people through decentralized and open source systems.<p><strong>Trustlines Protocol</strong> represents a set of rules, processes and definitions forged into deployable code. It will comprise several technical components used to calculate paths and store transactions, i.e. smart contracts, the Trustlines Blockchain and the code for the relay servers.

Instead, any Disputes will be settled through amicable negotiations and/or through binding arbitration.<li>You are not registered on any of the following sanction lists; United Nations Sanctions (UN), US Consolidated Sanctions OFAC, Specially Designated Nationals (SDN), EU Financial Sanctions, UK Financial Sanctions (HMT), Australian Sanctions, Switzerland Sanction List - SECO, INTERPOL Wanted List, Consolidated Canadian Autonomous Sanctions List, Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada), Bureau of Industry and Security (US), Department of State, AECA Debarred List (US), Department of State, Nonproliferation Sanctions (US), or any other internationally recognised sanction list.<li>Any and all of your actions, whether directly or indirectly related to the Auction, the Validator technical capabilities, the Validator Slots and the Trustlines Protocol comply with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, (i) legal capacity and any other threshold requirements in your jurisdiction (ii) and any foreign exchange or regulatory restrictions applicable to such actions.</ol><h1>Review and testing of the Smart Contracts</h1><p>The Smart Contracts have been, on a reasonable effort basis, reviewed, tested, and approved by technical experts. The technical experts have confirmed to the Foundation that the Auction Smart Contracts have, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according to the current state of the art. The Validator Candidate, however, understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early development stage and its application is of an experimental nature that carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory, and reputational risks. Accordingly, while the conducted review and testing raises the level of security and accuracy, in theory, the Validator Candidate understands and accepts that the review and testing does not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contracts are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of the Ether sent to the Smart Contracts and/or held in the Smart Contract.<h1>Associated risks</h1><p>By participating in the Auction, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:<ul><li>Risk​ ​of​ ​losing​ a Validator Slot, TLN bid or Stake​ due​ ​to​ ​loss​ ​of​ ​private​ ​key(s);<li>Risks​ ​associated​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Ethereum​ blockchain: any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on the Smart Contracts;<li>Risk​ ​of​ ​mining​ ​attacks: the Auction Smart Contract is susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating bids on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Auction including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of bids;<li>Risk​ ​of​ ​hacking​ ​and​ ​security​ ​weaknesses: hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Auction in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing;<li>Risk​ ​of​ ​uninsured​ ​Losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at financial institutions, the TLN held in the Auction Smart Contract is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Foundation, to offer recourse to you;<li>Risks​ ​associated​ ​with​ ​uncertain​ ​regulations​ ​and​ ​enforcement​ ​actions: the regulatory status of, including but not limited to the Auction, the Validator Slots, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including but not limited to the Auction and the Validator Slots. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the whole Trustlines Protocol in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, that some or all of the parties involved in the Trustlines Protocol in general might require licensing or is subject to existing legislation;<li>Risks​ ​arising​ ​from​ ​taxation; the tax characterization of acquiring a Validator Slot and/or acting as a Validator is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with your partaking in the Auction, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements.<li>Unanticipated​ ​risks: blockchain technology and the Trustlines Protocol are a new and limitedly tested technology. In addition to the risks referred to above, there are other risks associated with your partaking in the Trustlines Auction, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks previously referred to.</ul><h1>Indemnification</h1><p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Foundation and its Affiliates from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to (i) you participating in the Auction; (ii) your obligations, representations and warranties under these Terms, (iii) your violation of these Terms, and/or (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, directly and indirectly, related to the Auction.<h1>Exclusion of Warranties</h1><p>To the full extent permitted by law, no warranty, guarantee or similar assurance whatsoever is expressed or implied with regard to the Trustlines Protocol and its components.
